# Acquisition-Analysis---SQL-Project

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the potential acquisition of Parch & Posey by Dunder Mifflin, analyzing market trends, revenue streams, and sales performance. The goal is to determine whether expanding into new regions would provide strategic growth opportunities and operational benefits for both companies.

## Key Objectives
- Assess the current market position** and growth trajectory of Parch & Posey.  
- Identify new market opportunities** in North, South, and International regions.  
- Evaluate sales representative productivity and recommend **optimal resource allocation.  
- Determine high-value customer segments to enhance targeting strategies.  
- Analyze marketing channel effectiveness and recommend optimizations.  

## Findings 

### 1. Regional Performance & Sales Optimization
- The Southeast and West regions generate the highest revenue and order volumes.  
- Sales reps in these regions handle a large number of accounts, potentially reaching capacity limits.  
- Reallocating sales reps from the Midwest and Northeast to new markets would have minimal impact on existing operations.  

### 2. Customer & Account Analysis
- The current segmentation is ineffective for identifying larger accounts.  
- High-value accounts can be better identified based on paper type preferences (Standard, Gloss, Poster) and acquisition channels.  

### 3. Marketing Channel Optimization 
- Certain marketing channels are underperforming and should be deactivated:
  - West: Banner Ads  
  - Southeast & Northeast: Twitter  
  - Midwest: Banner Ads  
- Optimizing marketing strategies can improve customer acquisition efficiency in key regions.  

## Recommendations

### 1. Expansion into New Markets 
- Reallocate experienced sales reps to North, South, and International regions.  
- Start with a pilot reallocation and monitor market response before scaling.  

### 2. Targeting High-Value Customers
- Prioritize accounts based on paper type preferences** and **acquisition channels to maximize revenue potential.  

### 3. Strategic Acquisition Decision  
- Dunder Mifflin should acquire Parch & Posey to:  
  - Expand into new territories and access larger accounts.  
  - Achieve economies of scale through cost-saving synergies (bulk purchasing, streamlined operations, shared services).  
  - Strengthen market positioning and gain a competitive advantage.  

## Next Steps**  
- Conduct further research on new regions (International, South, North) to assess market potential.  
- Analyze competitor strategies in both existing and new markets.  
- Evaluate Parch & Poseyâ€™s assets to determine their long-term value.  
- Optimize marketing channels based on web event data to enhance customer engagement.
